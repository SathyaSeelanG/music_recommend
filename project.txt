# Music Mood Detector - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
A web application that detects user's emotional state through facial recognition and recommends music based on their mood. The system uses deep learning for emotion detection and provides personalized music recommendations.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Core Components
- **Emotion Detection**: Custom CNN model for facial expression analysis
- **Music Recommendation**: Reinforcement Learning based recommendation system
- **Web Interface**: Flask-based responsive UI
- **External APIs**: YouTube API for music playback

### 2. Key Features
- Real-time facial emotion detection
- Multi-language music support
- Dynamic music recommendations
- YouTube integration
- User feedback system
- Responsive UI design

## Technical Details

### 1. Emotion Detection System
```python
class EmotionDetector:
    # Supports 7 emotions:
    emotions = ['angry', 'disgust', 'fear', 'happy', 'neutral', 'sad', 'surprise']
    
    # CNN Architecture:
    - Input Layer (48x48x1)
    - Conv2D layers with MaxPooling
    - Dense layers with Dropout
    - Output Layer (7 emotions)
```

### 2. Music Recommendation System
```python
# Features considered:
- Valence (musical positiveness)
- Energy (intensity)
- Danceability
- Tempo
- Mode (major/minor)
```

### 3. Emotion-Music Mapping
```csv
Emotion  | Music Characteristics
---------|---------------------
Happy    | High valence, high energy
Sad      | Low valence, low energy
Angry    | High energy, low valence
Neutral  | Moderate values
```
